# Maze-Solver-Robot
This is an autonomous line maze solver robot. Each line maze has a Start point and a Finish point. The robot is expected to follow the lines and find its way from Start to Finish in the fastest time possible.So here we have used two techniques to solve the line maze and they are:
1. Using Left-hand rule
2. Using Image Processing technique

Both of them are well explained in their docs and the code for the hardware are also included in this repo.
